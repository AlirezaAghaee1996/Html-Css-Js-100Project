# Creative Image Hover Effect

This project demonstrates an innovative image hover effect using CSS clip-paths and transitions.

## Features

- Three overlapping images with unique clip-path shapes
- Smooth transition animations on hover
- Interactive hover effects that reveal full images
- Responsive design
- Clean and modern implementation

## How It Works

The project creates a creative image gallery where:
1. Three images are positioned absolutely in a container
2. Each image has a unique clip-path shape
3. On hover, images smoothly transition to reveal their full content
4. Individual images can be hovered to expand them fully

## Technical Details

- Uses CSS `clip-path` property for creative image shapes
- Implements smooth transitions using CSS `transition`
- Uses absolute positioning for image layering
- Background images are set using CSS `background` properties
- Responsive container sizing

## Customization

You can customize:
1. Image URLs and content
2. Clip-path shapes and positions
3. Transition timing and effects
4. Container dimensions
5. Background colors and styling

## Browser Support

- CSS clip-path
- CSS transitions
- CSS background properties

## Implementation Notes

- Images are loaded from Unsplash (replace with your own images)
- Clip-path values can be adjusted for different shapes
- Transition timing can be modified for different effects
- Container size can be adjusted for different layouts
